## Buying a Domain

1. Look for a Registrar, in my case, I use Niagahoster, a local Indonesian Web Hosting Service and DNS Registrar.

2. Choose a Top Level Domain (e.g. `.com`, `.io`, `.online`, etc.).

3. Configure your own domain name (DNS).

4. Check-out the created domain name.

5. Since the IP already embedded within the DNS, the last step is to wait until the Transaction is completed.

6. All done! Now proceed to the next step...

## Connect GitHub to Netlify

1. To deploy your web page which stored in the GitHub repo, we can use Netlify as a free web host.

2. Login to Netlify and open Sites section, then Add new site, and lastly choose Import an existing Project.

## Deploy your Netlify Webpage on the Bought Domain

1. After successfully bought the domain, check the our dashboard in the registrar website, and look for DNS nameserver.

2. Open the registrar domain dashboard, and enter the name server generated by Netlify as the name server to embed your netlify hosted web page on the bought domain.
